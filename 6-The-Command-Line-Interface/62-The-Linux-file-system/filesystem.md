# Important Notes

1. **Role of Operating System in File Management:**
   - The operating system manages files through a file management system or file system.

2. **Historical Storage of Programs and Data:**
   - Programs and data were once stored on punch cards.
   - Each box in the picture contains 2,000 punch cards, with each card holding up to 80 characters.
   - Total characters stored on punch cards in the picture: approximately 4.3 billion, similar to a four-gigabyte flash drive.

3. **Revolution with Disk Drives:**
   - Storing programs on disk drives revolutionized programming.
   - Disk drives allowed storing hundreds, thousands, or millions of files without physical boxes.

4. **File System Visualization:**
   - A file system is visualized as a tree, with files grouped into directories or folders.
   - Directories contain files and/or other directories, creating a hierarchical tree structure.

5. **Unix/Linux File System Notation:**
   - In Unix/Linux, the root of the file system is denoted as "/" (slash).
   - Example notation: `/folder/subfolder/file`.

6. **User Organization of Files:**
   - Users decide how to organize their files and folders.

7. **File System Hierarchy Standardization (FSSTND):**
   - Started in August 1993 to standardize the file system hierarchy for GNU Linux.

8. **Common Linux Directories:**
   - `/bin`: Basic commands for minimal system use.
   - `/sbin`: Binaries for the super user (root).
   - `/home`: User directories (e.g., `/home/smith`, `/home/remi`).
   - `/root`: Home directory of the root user.
   - `/etc`: Configuration files.
   - `/lib`: Software libraries for executables in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
   - `/tmp`: Temporary files directory.
   - `/var`: Various files used by the operating system.
   - `/usr`: Unix System Resources, extends system operations.
   - `/dev`: Files corresponding to physical devices.

9. **Specifics of /usr Directory:**
   - `/usr/bin`: Executable binaries not in `/bin` (non-essential to minimal system).
   - `/usr/lib`: Libraries not essential for a minimal system.

10. **/dev Directory in Linux:**
    - Contains files corresponding to physical devices, treating everything as a file.
    - Examples: `/dev/printer`, `/dev/audio`, `/dev/mem`, `/dev/networkcard`.

11. **Understanding File System Structure:**
    - The file system structure is hierarchical, with directories and files organized in a tree.
    - Various directories serve specific purposes, such as storing executables, configuration files, and temporary data.

12. **Further Exploration:**
    - Understanding the file system structure is a foundation for exploring its contents.
