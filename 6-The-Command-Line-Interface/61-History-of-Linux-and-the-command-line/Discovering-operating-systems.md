# Operating Systems Genesis: Definition, Services, and Key Dates

Linux, a Unix-like operating system, stands as an open-source marvel. The Linux kernel, crafted by Linus Torvalds and nurtured by a global community of programmers, is freely available to the world.

## What is an Operating System?

> An operating system acts as the vital intermediary between hardware components (memory, hard disk, processor, Wi-Fi network cards, etc.) and the applications we use daily.
>
> Applications leverage the services provided by the operating system, which, in turn, optimally utilizes the available hardware resources to serve these applications.

## Examples of Operating System Services:

1. **File Management:**
   - Organizing the logical tree structure of files and their physical layout on the storage device (hard drive).

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Facilitating the sharing of memory among multiple running processes.

3. **Management of Running Applications:**
   - Overseeing running processes, allowing tasks such as launching and terminating applications.

4. **Input and Output Management:**
   - Handling diverse inputs and outputs, including network cards, sound cards, video cards, printers, and more.

## History of the Operating System:

> In the mid-1940s, the first computers relied on vacuum tubes, large glass containers capable of controlling electric current. These early machines were massive, filling entire rooms and performing slower than modern calculators.
> 
> The programming of these machines involved manual manipulation of tubes, and the limited input-output capabilities meant the programmer also assumed the roles of both builder and operator.
>
> The game-changer came with the invention of the transistor. This marked the inception of operating systems using punch cardsâ€”cards with holes encoding computer programs and data. Operators loaded these cards into the computer's memory via a punch card reader, introducing a division of roles. Programmers created punch cards, and operators handled their physical loading.

This era saw the birth of the operating system in the mid-1960s, tasked with managing memory, processes, and programs, including the reading and writing of punch cards for inputs and outputs.
